# Identify Customer Segments
Project part of Udacityâ€™s Data Scientist Nanodegree

## Project Overview
In this project, unsupervised learning algorithms are used to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
